    "The game is guessing game somewhat reminiscent of Guppies but now competitive between two players.  The game shows the players a scatterplot of two columns selected randomly from a file, and asks each to guess what the correlation of the two columns is.  The player with the closest guess in each round gets a point.  The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.  For an example of what the game should look like, see [`A7_sample_output.ipynb`](A7_sample_output.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "To organize your code, much of the game is broken into separate functions.  Each section below contains one function that you should develop.  Each function is specified in a **documentation comment** at the start of the function (often called a \"docstring\") describing what the function should do, what arguments it takes, and what it returns (if anything).  Follow the given specification exactly, and write your code for each function after the documentation comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each function, there is a place to test the function.  Write some code matching the described test, and use that to test your function as you develop it.  The tests will help you know when each function is working correctly.  Feel free to write and use additional tests as well for further confirmation that your code is correct and/or for help finding bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is always a good idea to test any code you write with a variety of inputs.  In this directory, we've provided two .csv files to test against; feel free to add others to try as well."
