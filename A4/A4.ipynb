You should take each problem's goal and break it down as much as you can into small tasks, then think about how to accomplish each of those tasks.  You'll need to think about the range of tools we have covered to figure out which might be most applicable to each small task.  If you ever get stuck, though, please get in touch with an instructor or TA, and we'll be happy to help you move forward."
